# Apple Pass Generator

__Version:__ 0.1.7

## Overview

Python library to generate passes i.e (.pkpass) files compatible with Apple Wallet (former Passbook).

## Pass Types

Currently, Apple Wallet supports [5 pass types](https://developer.apple.com/wallet/) all of which can be generated by this library:

1. **Boarding Pass**

    Train tickets, airline boarding passes, and other types of transit passes. Each pass usually corresponds to a single trip with a specific starting and ending point.

2. **Coupons**

    Coupons, special offers, and other discounts. If an offer has expired, the coupon can be updated with a new offer and expiration date.

3. **Event Tickets**

    Entry into concerts, movies, plays, sporting events, or other events. Typically, each pass corresponds to a specific event, but you can also use a single pass for several events as with a season ticket.

4. **Store Cards**

    Store loyalty cards, discount cards, points cards, and gift cards. If an account related to a store card carries a balance, the pass can be updated to display the current balance.

5. **Generic**

    Any other type of pass, such as a gym membership card, in-store pickup receipt, or coat-check claim ticket.
